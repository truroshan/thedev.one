# Who am I?

I am **Roshan Kumar Rajak**, a graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA).  I love solving problems that I encounter in my daily life with technology, and then sharing them with the world.

I am shamelessly looking for a full time software engineering role so feel free to reach out :)
